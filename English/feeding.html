                This is something that we can't stress enough. Rabbits are not omnivores. They are not carnivores. They are herbivores.
                This means that they rely on a strict plant-based diet. This is because they need a lot of fiber in their diet. 
                One of the key characteristics of a rabbit is that the four front teeth are constantly growing.
                The only way in which they are able to wear these teeth down is to be constantly grazing on fiber. 
                The only way to get a lot of fiber is through plants.

            <p>
                Ensure your rabbits have constant access to fresh, clean water.
                Provide water in a heavy ceramic bowl. Bottles are unnatural and can get stuck leading to dehydration. 
                Rabbits drink a surprisingly large amount of water. They should drink about as much water as a small 
                dog would drink in a day. That comes out to around 1-2 cups of water per day. But, of course, the 
                amount of water a rabbit drinks will vary depending on a number of factors. Larger rabbits will drink 
                more water, as well as rabbits that are pregnant. Rabbits are also likely to drink more in the hotter 
                months of the year or if they are very active rabbits.

            Hay daily
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Make sure they always have hay. Hay is 80% of a rabbits' diet. Good quality, fresh hay should be available 
                at all times. Hay is very high in fiber, which is absolutely essential to a rabbit's diet. Because of the 
                rabbit's foraging ancestors, their long digestive tract is set up to break down fibrous vegetation. The long 
                fiber strands of hay work much better than the ground-up fiber in commercial rabbit pellets for keeping the 
                rabbits gut moving.

            Fresh Leafy Greens
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Fresh greens provide your rabbit with the nutrients they need to thrive. Plus, rabbits 
                absolutely love their vegetables. It's great for their mental enrichment to give them additional 
                flavors and textures, so try introducing some new types of veggies sometimes, to find out what your 
                rabbit's favorites are.
                About 10% to 15% of your rabbit's diet should be made of of these fresh leafy greens. The amount 
                you need to give will depend on the size of your rabbit, so use the guideline of providing at most 
                2.5 cups of greens every day for a 5 pound rabbit.

        <h1>
            Pellets
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Dry food rabbit pellets should make up a much smaller percentage of your rabbit's diet than you 
                may have been led to believe. Strictly speaking, pellets are not even a necessary part of your 
                rabbit's diet, but they can be an easy way to provide extra nutritional value and usually your 
                rabbit will love them. They should only make up about 5% of your rabbit's daily diet. 
                Again, rabbits have pretty drastic size differences so the amount of pellets you give them will 
                depend on the size of your rabbit. Try to stick to the guideline of a maximum of ¼ of a cup a day 
                for a 4 pound rabbit. 
                Don't worry if your rabbit gobbles up all the pellets right away or finishes them before the end 
                of the day. It's okay for them to have an empty bowl. Remember, your rabbit still has their 
                unlimited hay available for munching. You want to encourage your rabbit to eat more hay than 
                pellets, so you shouldn't replenish them until the next day
                You want to make sure you are getting a brand that is just the boring pellets. Anything with 
                colorful, fruity pieces is going to be way too high in sugar content and is not good for your 
                rabbit's health. Most rabbits will still love to gobble of those plain boring-looking pellets.
                Second, you want to take a look at the ingredients and make sure the first item on the list is 
                timothy hay or timothy grass. Like with hay, alfalfa pellets are okay for young rabbits (less 
                than 6 months) or underweight rabbits, but by the time your rabbit is reaching adulthood you want 
                to make sure to transition over to a timothy blend.

                You can use part of their daily ration of greens, pellets, forage, roots... as treats

                but don't feed any other treats, as these may harm your rabbit.

            Adjustments to diet for young rabbits
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Young rabbits are still growing and they will need more calcium and protein than their adult 
                counterparts. This is why alfalfa hay is recommended for young rabbits, even though it's not 
                ideal for their adult counterparts
                Up until about six months old, young rabbits should have access to unlimited alfalfa hay, 
                AND they should have unlimited access to pellets. As your rabbit reaches 6-7 months old, 
                you should start to transition them to timothy hay and begin to reduce the amount of pellets 
                they receive. But until the rabbit reaches 1 year old, they should still receive about double 
                the amount of pellets their adult counterparts receive.
