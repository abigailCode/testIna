            <p>
                Pet rabbits have bigger personalities than most people give them credit for. People who 
                have never had a pet rabbit may not understand that each rabbit has its own unique personality.
                All rabbits do things to communicate that they are happy, sad, or scared and while every rabbit 
                is different, certain behaviors mean the same thing for most rabbits.

            <p>
                This is a sign of a content rabbit. Usually, your rabbit will be resting, sitting up,
                and then roll onto its side to lie down. The rabbit will be very relaxed, their eyes will 
                most likely be closed and their legs will not be moving. Flopping is a normal rabbit behavior 
                and it means your rabbit is relaxed.

            <p>
                When we say a rabbit is grooming it means they are cleaning themselves, 
                kind of the equivalent to taking a shower. They'll do this regularly.

            <p>
                Cecotropes are full of nutrients that a rabbit needs. These special feces contain more protein 
                and vitamins than normal poops have, so by consuming its cecotropes (and a healthy diet), a rabbit 
                is getting all of the important nutrients that it needs to stay healthy.

                Rabbits that “periscope” are curious and trying to survey their surroundings. 
                If you think about a rabbit in the wild, this position offers an advantage for 
                rabbits to scope out predators or look for companions.

                A “binky” is when a rabbit jumps into the air, perhaps kicking and twisting.

                Rabbits are natural diggers. Their wild cousins dig burrows for nesting and 
                to make their homes and our house rabbits dig for fun. This is an instinctual 
                behavior but it can be bothersome and destructive for their humans that love 
                them. Rabbits will also dig on your feet or hands to get your attention. 
                Digging is normal!

                Rabbit Noises
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Rabbits are social and while most people who have never owned a rabbit have never heard a rabbit 
                make a noise you can rest assured that they have their own vocabulary to tell us and each other 
                how they feel. Some noises are very obvious such as screaming. A rabbit will only scream if they 
                are scared, stressed, or frightened. You will hopefully never hear a rabbit scream.
                Other less alarming noises include a buzz or honk noise, which can mean they are excited and is 
                usually done while they are circling and sniffing another rabbit, and teeth grinding. Teeth grinding 
                can mean your rabbit is uncomfortable or in pain but it can also mean they are content. If the teeth 
                grinding (also referred to as purring) is heard while your rabbit is sitting up, hunched, and not moving 
                then it most likely signifies they are in pain.
                If it is heard very softly while your rabbit is relaxed, such as after flopping, then it means they are relaxed. 
                Growling is another noise that you may hear if you have a territorial rabbit or if they are angry or stressed out. 
                Neutering or spaying your rabbit will help to relieve any territorial tendencies but you may still hear growling 
                if you are trying to introduce a new rabbit to your bunny. If you hear growling you should separate the rabbits 
                because a growl is an indication that a fight or other type of aggressive behavior may occur.

                Kicking
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Rabbits can deliver a very strong kick if they want to. They have powerful hind legs and if they are displeased they may kick 
                to try to get away or indicate they want to be put down if they are being held. If your rabbit appears to kick as they hop away 
                from you they are trying to kick up dirt to show they are upset. If a rabbit is kicking while you are holding them then you should 
                carefully set them down because they can hurt or paralyze their back if they kick hard enough while being held.

            </h2>
           
            <p>
                If your bunny is nudging his nose on its toys or on you it is because this is their way of exploring and investigating things. 
                Just like sharks bonk and nudge to get an idea of what it is they are looking at, rabbits have very sensitive little noses that 
                help them discover what makes up their environments. Sometimes a bonk or nudge is followed by a nip to further test it out or to 
                indicate that the rabbit wants you to move or pay attention to you.

            <p>
                Rabbits may give you an innocent nip to get your attention but they can also bite to show dominance, 
                out of fear, or to say they don't like something/someone. Rabbits may bite each other if they are 
                fighting or if an established rabbit doesn't like a new rabbit or to establish 
                a hierarchy with the other rabbits they live with, or simply because they don't want to do something if you 
                are trying to pick them up or put them in a cage. Rabbits aren't usually aggressive and neutering or spaying 
                can help resolve any aggressive tendencies.

                A rabbit that thumps their hind leg is an upset rabbit. Thumping is a sign that is meant to warn other rabbits

                Rabbits have scent glands on their face like many other animals. Sometimes rabbits will rub their 
                chin on something (referred to as chinning) to tell other rabbits that the object is theirs. 
                This is a normal way of marking their territory.

            <p>
                A hunched rabbit is an uncomfortable rabbit. Along with the hunched-over body, rabbits in this position will 
                often rest more of their weight onto their front paws to avoid their belly touching the ground. This is a sign 
                that there's something wrong with your rabbit's digestive system that may require a vet, such as GI stasis.
