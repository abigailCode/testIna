                    Bolt is a lively young bunny with big ears, full of energy and fearlessness. 
                    He was found abandoned in Barranco de La Ballena. 
                    He has already been to the vet for a check-up and is vaccinated. 
                    Soon, he wil be ready to find a loving home. If you're interested in opening 
                    your home to him, feel free to send us a private message. Summer has been tough 
                    for many bunnies, and we continue to deal with irresponsible individuals who 
                    don't think before taking on the responsibility of a living being.

                    Bruno is a very curious little bunny, nearly two years old, who loves cuddles and enjoys spending time by your side. 
                    This little one has completed all his veterinary procedures, including vaccinations, deworming, a microchip, and sterilization, making him ready for his forever home. 
                    We are in love with him, but we know he needs a home where he can be happy for the rest of his life. Could it be yours? 
                    If you've fallen for him and want to inquire about adoption, please don't hesitate to do so. We would be delighted if you're willing to give him a chance.

                    Cookie is becoming incredibly handsome. This little, big bunny has already recovered and received his first vaccine. 
                    He is now protected against the main diseases that affect rabbits (myxomatosis, viral hemorrhagic disease 1 and 2). 
                    He has gained weight as well, now reaching 800 grams!!! He is truly a champion. We don't understand how such a small 
                    body could endure so much pain, nor how people allowed him to suffer and be attacked by mites.

                <p>
                    Gandalf is a small-sized bunny who was abandoned in a village in Tenerife by the person he considered to be his family and who had raised him, 
                    which we find regrettable. Once you acquire an animal, it's for a lifetime. Since then, he has been living happily in his foster home, hoping that someone will 
                    notice him and open the doors to a new home. If you are interested in expanding your family, send us a private message, and we will provide you with information about the adoption conditions.

                <p>
                    Lila was abandoned along with three other bunnies. She was fortunate enough to be rescued, but sadly, her companions were not 
                    as lucky and were found lifeless. When we picked her up, she weighed only 1.2 kilograms, but now she has grown to a healthy 2.2 kilograms! 
                    We believe she is a mix of a Holland Lop due to her long ears. Sometimes, she drags one, but when she gets nervous, she raises both. 
                    She is a very good and shy bunny who loves sharing her life with other bunnies, and most importantly, she loves to eat!

                    Nieve (male) is a handsome 3-year-old bunny who will soon be available for adoption. He has a very good nature and follows you everywhere. 
                    All that's left is for him to undergo his neutering surgery to be ready to join his new family. Would you like him to become a part of your family?

                    Rub√≠ was thrown into the street along with a companion by the people who raised her and got tired, not hesitating to abandon them to their fate in a world 
                    that was completely unknown to them. Rub√≠ is of small size and shy, and we imagine that the abandonment took its toll on her. Her foster home, which rescued her, only has good words for her. 
                    If you're thinking about adopting a life companion, don't hesitate to send us a private message, and we will tell you how.

                This Association was founded on December 23, 2016, thanks to a group of people concerned about the situation of animals on our island: abuse not pursued or condemned by the law. 
                The purpose is to help these little forgotten ones, rabbits, and any small rodent in trouble. We operate based on foster homes where the doors are opened to them, and the 
                dignity of these little 'broken toys' is restored. 90% of our income relies on private donations and markets; without them, we couldn't continue our mission. We are located 
                in Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain.
